## Introduction

> This is the AirBnb Reviews Service. While the service itself is stand-alone, it was built to be part of an entire AirBnb replica listing page. This replica page was built with 3 other individuals and they each handled a particular of the site design. We worked as a team to build and develop these services and were able to bring them together on a single page.

> I was responsible for the design, implementation and execution of the Reviews Service and making sure it was able to integrate properly with all the other services our team developed.
